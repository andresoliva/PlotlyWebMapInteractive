# Data Collector Station (DCS) Plotter

This Python script is designed to receive and plot data from a Data Collector Station (DCS). The received data is expected to be in a Pandas-compatible array format.

## About

This script was created as part of an engineering master's degree thesis at Instituto Balseiro, Argentina, by Andres Oliva Trevisan. It allows you to visualize data received from a DCS on a map. The script can either read data from a real serial port or simulate data for testing purposes.

### Tested Library Versions

- Dash: 2.10.2
- Plotly: 5.14.1

## Getting Started

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following commands:


pip install pyserial pandas plotly dash


3. Run the script, which will start a Dash web application.

## Usage

- Select the serial port you want to use from the dropdown menu.
- The script will continuously read data from the selected serial port or simulate data if the "Simulate Serial Port" option is chosen.
- The received data will be displayed on a map with markers indicating various information about the DCS devices.

## Dependencies

- [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/): A Python web application framework.
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/): A graphing library for interactive visualizations.
- [PySerial](https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/): A Python library for serial communication.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): A data manipulation library.
